# Normalize Proxy

Install a remote repository locally to be served via SPDY Push.

## Platform

This server is designed to run on UNIX systems and is thus able to avoid many issues and code bloat.
Since this proxy is __not__ designed to be run on clients, there's no need to support Windows.
However, a `Dockerfile` will be included to make it easy for you to setup a proxy in a VM.
